helloelf64
A real basic example in generating a real bare bones
ELF executable.
It is a simple "hello world" program that safely exits
at the end.
The generated program is effectively this assembly:
mov rax, 1 			; select write() system call */
mov rdi, 1 			; select stdout as file descriptor */
mov rsi, 0x4009A 	; move pointer to our string to rsi
mov rdx, 0x0F		; move the length of our string to rdx
syscall 			; actually call write()
mov rax, 60			; select exit() system call
mov rdi, 0 			; exit status 0 for success
syscall				; actually call exit()
